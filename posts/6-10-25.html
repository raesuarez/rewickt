      <h1>The Last of Us II</h1>
      <p>
      WARNING: This post contains spoilers of The Last of Us II. It is an excellent game and the TV show does not do it justice. If you have any desire to play it, please do it now and come back to this post. 
      </p>
      <p>
      You've been warned…
      </p>
      <p>
      It's a bit weird that I am reviewing TLOU2 without talking about the first game, The Last of Us, but I played it way too long ago and way too quickly. I sort of fell into the same trap while playing its sequel. I found myself rushing through the main plot points to get a full picture and I missed a lot of smaller details. I also missed the hype for both of these games by several years, so my opinions lack peer pressure and aren't rooted in the impact this game had on the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you don't know, TLOU tells the story of Ellie and Joel, who are traveling across the United States in an effort to find a cure for the apocalypse-inducing fungal infection that began spreading about 20 years before the story begins. Ellie is immune to this infection, which is why she is vital to finding the cure. However, after arriving at the hospital, Joel learns that Ellie has to die in order for a cure to be found. Joel then kills everyone in the hospital in order to save Ellie, and they escape.
      </p>
      <p>
      TLOU2 takes place five years after the end of TLOU, after Ellie and Joel settle in Jackson, WY, a small settlement of survivors.

      <h2>
        The Controversy of It All
      </h2> 
      <p>
      The question of whether Joel was right or wrong to have saved Ellie is much more interesting left to a hypothetical, and this sequel doesn't attempt to answer that question. Instead, it adds weight to this question by exploring the cycle of revenge Joel started.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joel's death in the early stage of this game was definitely going to upset a lot of players. Maybe it's the 20 seasons of Grey;s Anatomy I've watched but if you can't stomach the death of a major character in your favorite franchise without sending death threats to an actress, you are weak and should never engage with a piece of media ever again.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, forcing the player to play as Joel's killer, Abby Anderson, right before he dies is absolutely cruel, especially without any hint to a motive or reason. It's a great way to get the player to hate this new character, which motivates you to find her. It's an insane gamble to try and make the player later empathize with this character and root for her, which I do think this game does successfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        In TLOU, your goal is to get Ellie to the hospital to find a cure, but when you finally arrive, there is a moral reason stopping you from doing so. TLOU2 follows that same pattern. Your goal is to kill Abby, and when you are finally face to face with her (twice!!), the game presents yet another moral dilemma that stops you from completing this goal. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason TLOU was so successful was the moral conundrum the game left you in after all the events had unfolded. It makes sense that a sequel would want to capitalize on that controversy. I don't understand why people are upset with the sequel for pushing player boundaries. TLOU2 is meant to make you uncomfortable, as any good story should.

      </figure> 
      <h2>Abby MF Anderson</h2>
      <p>
        Abby Anderson, oh how I love you so. Unlike most people, I was unbelievably excited to play as Abby because she is the hottest video game character I have ever seen. She is incredibly ripped and so strong she could kill infected with her bare hands. Besides making me giggle and twirl my hair, it was actually much easier for me to play this game as Abby because of her strength. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Your first impression of Abby is obviously not great. By the second time you play as her, you kill Joel, and you don't even find out why until halfway through the game. But by the last time you see her, you feel bad for her. Finding Abby at the end of this game made me tear up. Somehow, Naughty Dog is able to get you to hate a character so much you want her dead, to actually feeling bad for her and sparing her life.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems like an impossible task, but they achieved it. The moment you play as Abby again after killing Joel, the game immediately shows you her guilt. Her nightmares and conversations with friends are all lightly plagued by the guilt she carries for killing Joel and bringing all her friends into it. The plot itself does not spare Abby, as she loses everyone she cares about by the time she is face to face with Ellie. Abby has to face the consequences of her actions in order to grow as a character, and her growth is shown off right in front of the player. It becomes hard to hate someone you have now become attached to.
      </p>
      <p>
      Abby's growth is directly represented through her relationship with Lev, a young boy from the opposing militia group who rescues Abby after she'd been kidnapped. She takes care of him to essentially make herself feel better and shake off some of the weight on her shoulders. Although it seems selfish, it does work. Lev is the only person that Abby cares about that survives the events of the game. The plot rewards her for breaking out of the cycle of violence and revenge.

      <h2>War and Violence</h2>
      <p>
      The portrayal of the conflict between the Seraphites and WLF is a great representation of the unnecessary violence and loss in war. The Seraphites are a cult-ish antiquated settlement in Seattle that are in a power struggle with the WLF, Washington Liberation Front, a paramilitary group also settled in Seattle. While you play as Abby, a high ranking member of the WLF, you watch the war unfold in the background. 
      </p>
      <p>
       The final day you play as Abby, you have to navigate through the Seraphites camp as it is getting destroyed by the WLF. I couldn't help but think about how stupid it is to attack other living people during a zombie apocalypse. These are people who should be sticking together to survive and outlive the infected, but here they are burning each other's buildings down and killing each other for power. Power can't even be promised in this world, because it's literally taken over by fucking zombies.  
      </p>
      <p>
      The game drives home this unnecessary violence point even further throughout smaller details. When you kill a soldier, the surrounding soldiers will scream out their name. They also cry out in pain, unlike the infected who just slowly fall to the ground. The game emphasizes the pain you are causing to real people, even if it doesn't let you progress without killing them. It also forces you to kill dogs.   
      </p>
      <p>
      This display of violence juxtaposed with the cycle of revenge that Ellie and Abby are participating in makes quite a statement against war and violence. No one wins in the conflict between the WLF and the Seraphites, and both Ellie and Abby lose everything in their pursuit of revenge. The game goes to great lengths to show that there are no winners in war.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Cycles of Violence</h2>
      <p>
      TLOU2 is quite in your face about the main theme of this game, which is this perpetual cycle of revenge and violence carried out by the main characters Ellie and Abby. Joel killed Abby's dad, Abby killed Joel, and now Ellie is set on killing Abby. This endless pursuit results in everyone losing their loved ones or their lives. This theme juxtaposed with the senseless war going on in the background creates an almost anti-war and anti-violence argument that you would not expect from such a violent video game. But seeing that revenge and destruction does not end well for anyone, it's hard to see how one would still want to partake in this cycle. 
      </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/ellieMeme.PNG" alt="its a pic of ellie with the caption ''Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves' what a stupid fucking quote im killing way more than two people'" style="width:100%">
      </figure> 
      <p>
       At the end of the game, we see Joel and Ellie's final conversation. Ellie tells Joel that she thinks she can't ever forgive him [for saving her] but she would like to try. This final flashback is triggered right as Ellie is about to kill Abby, but in the end she lets her go. To forgive Joel, she must also forgive Abby and quit pursuing this cycle. It cost her everything except her life.
      </p>
       
     
      <h2>Quick Bones to Pick</h2>
      
      <p>
      Half of the non playable women in this game were pregnant. Someone at Naughty Dog definitely has a breeding kink, because this is just ridiculous. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I also just believe that if you are creating a highly fictional piece of media, you don't have to include homophobia. I don't care if that's a bad take. You are creating a world that isn't real. Evaluate whether or not the world you are creating will benefit from it (it probably won't). I think we should all learn from Bridgerton and even go a step further to do gender blind castings. 
      </p>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2> 
        <figure>
      <img src="../images/myface.JPG" alt="its me looking shocked" style="width:100%">
      <figcaption> literally my face when i finished this game</figcaption>
      </figure> 
      <p>
       I truly just loved this game start to finish. Publishing a game like this is definitely risky, but TLOU had such an active fan base that they got away with it. I still don't really understand why most people hated this game. A sequel where you just play as Joel and Ellie again would have been so boring and disappointing, and I'm so glad that Naughty Dog went in a completely different direction. Abby is such an interesting (and sexy) character and the split between Ellie and Abby gameplay was a great way to add perspective. I don't think they could've made people care about Abby any other way than making you experience her.

          Ok this is the end of the post now. I dont have a comment section but like text me if you have thoughts. Ok bye
