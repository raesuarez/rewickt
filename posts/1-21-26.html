    <p>my faves from this month</p>
  i think all of 2025 i was pretty much in a transitional period and was consuming a lot of media i was comfortable with, but i am trying to branch out into new stuff this year now that i am settled in chi town. i did LOVE heated rivalry and also have been repeating harrys new single. also really into geese which apparently is trendy rn bc of tiktok. i hate how much tiktok influences what spotify pushes.
